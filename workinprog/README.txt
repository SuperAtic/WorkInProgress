workinprog 1.x for Drupal 7
Created by SuperAtic
http://drupal.org/project/workingprog

The New Semantic Theme for Drupal 6

WorkInProg is a fancy canvas for site developers. 
Use WorkInProg as a starting point to facilitate your site development.
Build site themes without feeling like you have to reinvent the wheel or remove unnecessary code every time.

workinprog 1 is intended to be used with the "Seven" administration theme included with Drupal 7.

Framework is actively developed and supported on my own time. If you would like to say thanks, please consider donating via:

USAGE

Install to sites/all/themes

To fully convert Framework to your own custom theme, it is encouraged that you: 
 - Copy the 'workinprog' directory within sites/all/themes/ and rename it as 'yourthemename' 
 - Change the filename and contents of the .info file accordingly
 - Use find/replace in template.php to replace 'workinprog' with 'yourthemename' 
 - Upload and enable the theme
 - Modify as needed

To create a sub-theme based on Framework, see: http://drupal.org/node/225125
